IOT Weather Monitoring System


This GitHub repository consists of all the functions contributed by each member.
There is a total of 5 function files which are all ultimately compiled into a single file called main.py

Running the main.py after correctly setting up the Raspberry Pi and 4 sensors: Temperature & Humidity, Rain, and Light 
will only print out the values obtained by the sensors.

As it already connects to the unique API key to a ThingSpeak website, you have to run the python file via a command line such as:
python "path to the python file"

By opening the ThingSpeak website at: https://thingspeak.com/channels/953002, you can monitor the live upload of the data collected
from the 4 sensors.


Team Members: Andrew Ko, Brian Weku, Sofian, Edgar Tandiawan, and Adrian Pratama.
